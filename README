This program calculates the rigid body motion of a heavy polar molecule in an electric
field, by numerically integrating Euler's equations of motion. The quaternion representation
of rotations is used. There is no analytic solution for this system and for strong fields
the motion is in unstable to chaos. This one requires lots of numeric integrations so it is
implemented in C/Python. It uses the ODE integration routines from GSL, and uses mayavi for
visualization of the motion.
